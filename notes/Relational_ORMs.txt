Take "ClassRoom" and "Student" as two models where Student table has an F.K classroom

class ClassRoom:
    - name
    - address

class Student:
    - classroom (ForeignKey, related_name="classroom_students")
    - name
    - age


1. Student.objects.create(name=, age=, classroom=<classroom_object>)
2. Student.objects.create(name=, age=, classroom_id=2)

3. Student.objects.filter(classroom_id=2)
    => Gives qs of students enrolled in classroom id 2

4. Student.objects.filter(classroom=<classroom_obj_2>)
    => Gives qs of students enrolled in classroom id 2

5. Student.objects.filter(classroom__name="One")
6. Student.objects.filter(classroom__address="KTM")


7. ClassRoom.objects.filter(classroom_students__name="Jane")
    => returns classroom queryset
    => Here 'classroom_students' is related_name in Student model

8. ClassRoom.objects.filter(classroom_students__age=21)
    => returns classroom queryset

9. if "c" is the classroom object then:
    => c.classroom_students.all() => It gives Student queryset
    => c.classroom_students.filter(name="Jon")  => It gives student queryset
