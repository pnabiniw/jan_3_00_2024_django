1. API stands for Application Programmable Interface
2. There are broadly two types of APIs
    i. SOAP APIs
        => SOAP APIs use XML data format to transfer data
        E.g.
        <name>Jon</name>
        <age>30</age>
        <address>KTM</address>


    ii. RESTful APIs.
        => REST APIs use JSON (Javascript Object Notation) format to transefer data
        E.g.
        {
            "name": "Jon",
            "age": 30,
            "address": "KTM"
        }
3. APIs are like the communication medium among two or more entities.
   => We can create APIs and use the same API to develop FE app and mobile app
