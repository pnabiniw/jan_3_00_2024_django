1. There are four different types of authentication for REST APIs
a. Basic Authentication
b. Session Authentication
c. Token Authentication
d. JWT (JSON WebToken)

1. In Basic Authentication, you need to send user credentials everytime you request APIs
2. In session authentication, user credentials is provided only during the login which returns a sessionId.
   The browser stores this sessionId in the cookies. Now everytime you request the server sessionID is also
   sent in the request header.

3. In token authentication, user credentials is provided only during the login which returns a token.
   The browser stores this token in LocalStorage. Now everytime you request the server token is also
   sent in the request header.

4. In JWT, a valid signatured token is generated by the server (which carries user information) and this
    signatured token is stored in the LocalStorage by browser. Now everytime you request the server, token is also
    sent in the request header. In JWT, token is not saved in the BE database.


# Authorization / Permission
1. Permission checks whether an authenticated user is permitted to perform a certain task or not
