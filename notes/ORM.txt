1. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping
2. It is a way of querying a database without having to write raw SQL queries
3. Rather we can directly write python code to query the database.
4. Django has default support for ORM. We do not need to install extra package for this service.


Let's See basic CRUD ORMs

Read
1. If "ClassRoom" is the name of a model
    => ClassRoom.objects.all() this query is equivalent to "SELECT * FROM CLASSROOM"
    => This gives us queryset
    => We can access the data from the queryset either by indexing or using loop

    classrooms = ClassRoom.objects.all()

    for classroom in classrooms:
        print(classroom.name)


    # filter
    classrooms = Classroom.objects.filter(address="KTM")
    classrooms = Classroom.objects.filter(address="KTM", name="Ten")

    # get
    classroom = ClassRoom.objects.get(name="One")

    => get() method returns single object (single row of a table)
    => get() method should always be used with unique attributes like username, email, id, phone etc.
    => There are two types of errors associated with get() method
        => MultipleObjectsReturned: It is raised when get() is used with data occurring multiple times in a table
        => DoesNotExist: It is raised when get() is used with data not present in the table
    => While using get() method always keep it inside try...except block

    Note: filter() method doesn't raise above errors.



2. Create
   # First Method
   ClassRoom.objects.create(name="One", address="KTM")

   # Second Method
   c = ClassRoom(name="Two", address="PKR")
   c.save()

# Update
We use update() method in ORM to update table rows
1. ClassRoom.objects.all().update(address="NPL")
    => update() method is used with queryset

2. ClassRoom.objects.filter(name="One").update(address="NPL")
3. ClassRoom.objects.get(id=1).update(address="NPL")  => This is not a valid ORM. It raises AttributeError


# Delete
We use delete() method to delete table rows
delete() method can be used with both queryset and an object

ClassRoom.objects.filter(name="One").delete()
ClassRoom.objects.get(id=2).delete() => Unlike update() method, this is a valid ORM
